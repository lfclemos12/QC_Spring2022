The aim for this project was to create a program that could parse text into different sections
of a GUI. Users can insert text using a GUI prompt or read in a text file, with all the text

To create the GUI, the program makes considerale use of the 'javax.swing' package for GUI components
and 'java.awt' packages for event listeners.
